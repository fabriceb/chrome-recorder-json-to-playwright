# chrome-recorder-json-to-playwright

This repo provides a tool to convert [Google Chrome DevTools' Recordings](https://goo.gle/devtools-recorder) JSON export to Playwright code.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install -g chrome-recorder-json-to-playwright
```

## Usage

### Via CLI

To use the interactive CLI, run:

```sh
$ npx chrome-recorder-json-to-playwright
```

The CLI will prompt you to enter the path of the directory or file that you would like to modify as well as a path to write the generated playwright tests to.

If you prefer to enter paths via the CLI, you can run the following command to export individual recordings:

```sh
$ npx chrome-recorder-json-to-playwright <relative path to target test file>
```

or for folders containing multiple recordings:

```sh
$ npx chrome-recorder-json-to-playwright <relative path to target test folder>/*.json
```

By default the output will be written to a `playwright` folder in the current working directory.

If you prefer a different output directory, specify that via CLI:

```sh
$ npx chrome-recorder-json-to-playwright <relative path to target test folder>/*.json --output=folder-name
```

or via the interactive CLI prompts.
